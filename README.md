## IUCN Red List API Credit
https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/

## Features: 

1. Load the list of the available regions for species
2. Take a random region from the list
3. Load the list of all species in the selected region — the first page of the results would suffice, no need for
   pagination
4. Create a model for “Species” and map the results to an array of Species.
5. Filter the results for Critically Endangered species:
   • Fetch the conservation measures for all critically endangered species
   • Store the “title”-s of the response in the Species model as concatenated text property.
   • Print/display the results
6. Filter the results (from step 4) for the mammal class
   • Print/display the results
